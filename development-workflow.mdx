## Overview

Once you have the app running locally, here are the key development tools and workflows to help you build your product efficiently.

## Connect Honu MCP in Cursor

The Honu MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides AI-powered assistance directly in Cursor for managing your business model and development workflow.

<Note>
  **Recommended Setup**: For the best experience with Honu MCP, we recommend using **Cursor Pro** with **Claude 4.5 Sonnet** or higher. This combination provides:
  
  - **Enhanced AI capabilities**: More sophisticated reasoning and code generation
  - **Better context understanding**: Improved ability to understand complex business requirements
  - **Advanced MCP integration**: Full access to all Honu MCP features and capabilities
  - **Faster response times**: Optimized performance for development workflows
  - **Reliable uptime**: Priority access to the latest AI models
  
  While Honu MCP works with other AI models, the Pro subscription with Claude 4.5 Sonnet delivers the most comprehensive and reliable development assistance.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Get your MCP connection details">

1. Log in to your [Honu platform dashboard](https://dashboard.honu.ai)
2. Navigate to the **Deve Tools** section
3. Copy your Cursor MCP connection configuration

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Cursor">

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Go to **Features** → **Model Context Protocol**
3. Add a new MCP server with your Honu configuration
4. Test the connection to ensure it's working

</Step>

<Step title="Start using Honu MCP">

You can now start developing your product with the help of Honu MCP in Cursor:

- **Review your Trello board**: Ask the Cursor AI agent to analyze your Trello product board and understand your project structure
- **Task Execution**: Get the Cursor AI agent to execute the tasks on the Trello board
- **Task Tracking**: As it executes the tasks, the Cursor AI agent will move the task in the correct column on the Trello board e.g. "In Progress" to "In Review" to "QA" to "Done".
- **Collaboration**: The Cursor AI agent will request your approval to proceed with the task. You will need to provide QA before final sign off.
- **Add Tasks**: You can ask the Cursor AI agent to add tasks to the Trello backlog.

## Component Development with Storybook

Storybook helps you develop and test UI components in isolation, making it easier to build a consistent design system.

### Start Storybook

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

This opens Storybook at `http://localhost:6006` where you can:

- **View all components**: Browse your component library with live examples
- **Test different states**: See how components look with various props and states
- **Interactive development**: Modify component props in real-time using Storybook controls
- **Visual testing**: Ensure components work across different scenarios

### Component Story Structure

Each component in the `components/` directory has a corresponding `.stories.tsx` file. For example:

- `components/hero-section/HeroSection.tsx` → component implementation
- `components/hero-section/HeroSection.stories.tsx` → Storybook stories

### Best Practices

- Create stories for different component states (default, loading, error, etc.)
- Use Storybook controls to make props interactive
- Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
- Document component usage and props in your stories

## Database Management with Drizzle Studio

Drizzle Studio provides a visual interface to inspect and manage your database during development.

### Start Drizzle Studio

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

This opens Drizzle Studio in your browser where you can:

- **Browse tables**: View all your database tables and their structure
- **Inspect data**: See actual data in your tables with filtering and sorting
- **Run queries**: Execute SQL queries directly against your database
- **Monitor relationships**: Visualize foreign key relationships between tables

### Database Schema Location

- Schema definitions: `lib/db/schema.ts`
- Database queries: `lib/db/queries.ts`
- Migrations: `lib/db/migrations/`



## Development Tips

- **Hot Reload**: All three tools (Next.js dev server, Storybook, Drizzle Studio) support hot reloading
- **Parallel Development**: Run multiple tools simultaneously in different terminal tabs
- **Component-First**: Use Storybook to build components before integrating them into pages
- **Data-Driven**: Use Drizzle Studio to understand your data structure and test queries
- **Business Alignment**: Use Honu MCP to ensure your development aligns with your business strategy
