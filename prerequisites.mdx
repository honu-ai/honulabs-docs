## Requirements overview

Before running the project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker Desktop**: Runs Postgres and any other services via containers.
- **Node.js (LTS) via nvm**: Recommended Node 20 LTS (Node 19+ supported).
- **Git**: To clone the repository.
- **pnpm**: Preferred package manager for this project.
- **Stripe account + secret key**: Required for local development. You’ll use your test mode secret key.

<Note>
  A **Stripe account** is required even for local development so the app can make API calls in test mode. The Dockerized stack handles webhooks for you—no Stripe CLI needed.
</Note>

## GitHub setup

Before cloning the repository, make sure your GitHub access is set up:

- Create or sign in to your **GitHub** account
- Configure your Git identity (once per machine):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

- Set up **SSH** for passwordless access (recommended):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy the printed key and add it to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
```

- Verify your connection:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Recommended: Cursor Pro + Honu MCP

For the best developer experience and AI-assisted workflows:

- Install **Cursor** and use a **Pro subscription**.
- Connect the **Honu MCP** within Cursor. You can copy the required MCP configuration from your **Honu business dashboard**.
  - Developers page URL format (replace with your business ID): `https://dashboard.honu.ai/business/{BUSINESS_ID}/developers`

## Install Docker Desktop

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="macOS">
    1. Download Docker Desktop for Mac (Apple silicon or Intel) from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
    2. Install and open Docker Desktop.
    3. Verify installation:
       
       ```bash
       docker --version
       docker compose version
       ```
    
    <Tip>Make sure Docker Desktop is running before starting the app.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Windows">
    1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
    2. Enable the recommended WSL 2 integration during setup.
    3. Verify installation with `docker --version`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Linux">
    1. Install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and Docker Compose for your distro.
    2. Add your user to the `docker` group so you can run Docker without `sudo` (see [post-install steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)).
    3. Verify with `docker --version` and `docker compose version`.

## Install Node.js with nvm

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions and align with the project’s expected version.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install nvm">

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
# Restart your shell, then load nvm (if needed)
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install and use Node LTS (recommended)">

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
node -v
pnpm -v
```

</Step>

<Step title="Alternative: specific version">

If you prefer a specific version, install Node 20.x or newer (Node 19+ supported):

```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Install pnpm (via Corepack)

We use **pnpm**. With modern Node versions, use Corepack to activate it:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
pnpm -v
```

If `corepack` is not found, ensure you restarted your shell after installing Node with `nvm` or update Node to the latest LTS.

<Note>
  On **Windows**, the `nvm-sh` installer above does not run natively. Use one of these options:
  - Install **WSL 2** and follow the same Linux `nvm` steps inside your WSL shell.
  - Use **nvm-windows**: [coreybutler/nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). Commands are similar (`nvm install 20`, `nvm use 20`).
</Note>

## Stripe account and keys (required)

1. Create or sign in to your account at [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com).
2. Switch to **Test mode**.
3. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...`).
4. Add it to your environment file as your Stripe secret. For example:

```bash
# .env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_********************************
```

The local Docker setup manages webhooks automatically. You do not need the Stripe CLI for local development.

## Next step

Once Docker and Node are ready, clone the SaaS Starter repository and follow the local run instructions in your project README. If you’re working through these docs, continue to [Local development](/development).
